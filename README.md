# Diabetes Prediction App

Description:
This is a web application built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health metrics. The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

Features:

Patient Data Input: Users can input their health metrics including pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.
Prediction: The app predicts whether the user has diabetes or not based on the input data.
Visualization: Visualizations are provided for each input feature compared against the dataset, indicating the user's data point.
Accuracy: The accuracy of the model is displayed based on the test data.
How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries (streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn, seaborn).
Run the diabetes_prediction_app.py file.
Input your health metrics through the sidebar sliders.
Get the prediction along with visualizations and accuracy.
Data Source:
The dataset used for training the model is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv).
